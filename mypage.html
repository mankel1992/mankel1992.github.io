        <h1>Mankel, Aaron</h1>
        <p>I am a Physics major who plans to attend graduate school for particle physics in the fall of 2020. I am a family man and have been married since 2017 and we now have a beautiful daughter who is a year and a half old. In the future i hope to continue doing research into the standard model and looking for new interesting physics. The reason i am studying computer science to help progress my physics career to be able to handle larger problems. </p>
